In order to implement the algorithm, an event based node from the library adhoccomputing was used. This event based node has internal event queue.

And the messages between the nodes are published through channels. Channels are simply a projection of edges in the topology.

In general, the algorithm has 4 different types of events:

1. Want privilege
2. Release privilege
3. Get request message
4. Get reply message

Further details and declarations about the algorithm can be found in the documentation.

To test the algorithm, firstly a proper topology is created. For Raymond's algorithm, it is K-ary tree.

In order to create K-ary topology, we need the number of nodes and minimum and maximum number of children for every node.

We started from the root and add node with the random number between minimum and maximum number of children.

At last, our randomized K-ary tree with our boundaries is prepared.

Note:

1. If the minimum and maximum number of nodes are equal to 1, the topology behaves like a linked list.

2. If the minimum and maximum number of nodes are equal to 2, the topology behaves like a binary tree.

After creating the topology, all nodes are started.

Then randomly selected nodes triggered for wanting privilege with time distributed according to Poisson distribution.

Then, the tester waits all the nodes to be in a state of not wanting the privilege.

Finally the information of all nodes are gathered and summed up to get the benchmark results.

Results includes these:

1. Total want privilege
2. Total duplicate want privilege
3. Total used critical section
4. Total released critical section
5. Total request message received
6. Total token message received
7. Total request message sent
8. Total token message sent

The relation between total want privilege and sum of total request message and total token message gives the message complexity.

In addition, relation between total want privilege and total released critical section gives the practical proof of no starvation and fairness.
